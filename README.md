Thanks for stopping by.

Here you can look back on over a decade of my attempts to contribute to open source. I realized this was a good solid virtuous path to attaining a valuable skill; this was correct.

It is frenetic as I mostly did not know what I was doing, only that if I consistently did things in this space, I would become better at it; this was also correct.

"It" in this case was how to implement ideas, be it in software or hardware. Github captures the majority of this activity and displays it for you here.

It also contains a few startup failures of my own that I thought might be interesting contributions to that vast amounts of full app code out there already, as often one would find libraries but not entire applications. Startups... that was the dream for many of us, the purpose behind much of why we wanted to code in the first place. Fulfilling this desire in others through this skill of programming was and is a steady source of income for the sane among us who stay healthy and keep relationships strong.

Have a great rest of your day.
